# Advent of Code 2022

## Compiling is bloat
I didn't want to manually compile after I finished writting my C++ code, so I
wrote runner.py to do it for me

1. ```python -m venv env```
2. ```source env/bin/activate```
3. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. ```./runner.py```

use ```./runner.py -h``` to see instruction

## Why is code quality bad
speed >> comprehensive code
